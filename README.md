##AirFrance Marketing Campaingn
  
• Should Media Contacts recommend a uniform strategy for Air France across search
engine publishers? Or would it be more effective to tailor each publisher strategy to
maximize return on investment?


• How can campaigns be improved to increase overall value gained from investment with a
search engine publisher? Should keywords be added or dropped from the campaign?
Should campaign tactics or copy be adjusted to improve campaign performance?


• What are the most important KPIs, and what impact will campaign changes have on these
KPIs?


• How should future SEM campaigns be structured? In the past, Media Contacts had
concentrated on Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo; was there now an opportunity to
optimize search advertising with metasearch companies such as Kayak?
